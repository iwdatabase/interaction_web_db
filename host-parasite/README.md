# Lafferty et al. (2006)
# General information
The study was conducted in Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve, Carpinteria, Santa Barbara County, California. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of parasites on food-web topology. The results are reported in detail in Lafferty et al (in press) with other publications forthcoming which examine connectance, chain length, vulnerability, etc. This publication also details how taxa and links were selected for inclusion and provides additional information on the species lists.
# Data type
The matrix breaks down into 4 subwebs: predator-prey, parasite-host, predator-parasite and parasite-parasite. Links are binary (presence or absence of interspecific interactions), but coded by type of trophic interaction and certainty. The links are from a combination of published reports, direct observations, and logical, but presumed interactions. A key is included as a text box in the matrix. The web is being updated regularly as new information is obtained.

Explanation of data format: This symmetrical web of Carpinteria Salt Marsh is comprised of 4 subwebs denoted by solid lines (clockwise: predator-prey, parasite-host, predator-parasite, parasite-parasite).  Consumers in columns, prey/hosts in rows.  Numerical entries represent links.  Different values represent different types of links.
N  = a confirmed link
N.1 represents a proposed/presumed link
0 = no link  
1 = first intermediate host  
1.2 = first and second intermediate host  
1.25 first and second intermediate host, excysts outside 2nd intermediat host  
2 = second intermediate host  
2.5 = second intermediate host external (non-trophic) cyst  
3 = final host  
4 = predator-prey  
4.11 = 4.1  
4.2 = egg predator  
5 = predation on free-living cercarial stage of a trematode  
6 = micropredation (mosquito)  
7 = predation on parasite in a host  
8 = predation on parasite in a host, transmission to predator possible  
9 = parasite - parasite (mostly intraguild predation)  

# Network from Lakes: Aishihik, Cold, Lake of the Woods, McGregor River, Parsnip River, Huron and Smallwood Reservoir:
# Canadian freshwater fish and their metazoan parasites (multiple sources)
# General information
Data on host use by parasites were obtained from 7 Canadian freshwater systems, either large lakes or rivers, in which most fish species have been surveyed for parasites. Only fish species for which at least 5 individuals have been examined per locality are included, because estimates of parasite infection level were inaccurate for smaller samples. All species of internal and external metazoan parasites were considered, which include the following groups: nematodes, acanthocephalans, cestodes, trematodes, monogeneans, leeches, copepods and branchiurans. When a species of internal worm occurred among sampled fish as both larval and adult forms, the two forms were treated as functionally distinct species; this convention is justified because larval and adult worms often have different modes of transmission, infect different fish species, and different organs within fish.
# Data type
Two types of data given for most datasets: prevalence, which describes the proportion of host individuals harboring a particular parasite species; and intensity of infection, which describes the average parasite load (number of individual parasites) per host individual. Prevalence and intensity data are presented as two separate interaction matrices. In addition, all datasets include information on the host sample size (number of host individuals examined for parasites) and one (Cold Lake) also included an independent estimate of host abundance.
