# Barrett & Helenurm (1987)  
General information  
This study took place in the boreal forest of central New Brunswick, Canada, from May to September of 1978, 1979, and 1980. The objective was to investigate the role of animals in pollination and seed dispersal. The study was designed to provide basic descriptive information on breeding systems, pollination biology, and phenology of understory herbs.  
Data type  
The authors recorded their data by counting the number of individual flower visitors caught on each plant species. The total number of individuals collected on each plant species provide a rough estimate of the level of visitation that each species received. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.

# Bartomeus et al. (2008)  
General information  
The authors compared uninvaded and invaded ecological communities, to examine how two species of invasive plants with large and showy flowers (Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta) affect the structure of Mediterranean plant–pollinator networks at the Natural Park of Cap de Creus, Catalonia.  
Data type  
Datasets describe the frequency of visits observed for each pollinator-plant interaction. The study involved pollinator surveys in 3 sites per study species. Pairs of invaded and uninvaded plots were samples in all sites. Sites were sampled every 2 weeks during the entire flowering period of both C. affine acinaciformis and O. stricta. Each plant species was sampled during 6 minutes. Each species was sampled for a total of 36 minutes per site. In total, each site was surveyed by pollinators for more than 6 hours.

# Bezerra et al. (2009)  
General information  
This paper contrasted a network of Malpighiaceae oil-flowers and associated oil-collecting bees from a Brazilian steppe ("caatinga") to whole pollination networks from all over the world available in the Interaction Web Database. The caatinga network had a perfectly balanced proportion of plants and animals (13 x 13) and was more nested and less modular than all of the 22 whole pollination networks studied. The authors concluded that the oil-flower subweb is more cohesive and resilient than whole pollination networks, reinforcing the hypothesis that each ecological service is in fact a mosaic of different subservices with a hierarchical structure ("webs within webs").      
Data type and methodological remarks  
The species interaction matrix describes the number of bee visits to 138 individual plants in natural clumps of 13 Malpighiaceae species during the flowering peak of each species. The number of bee visits  to flowers was registered over four consecutive days, from 5.00 to 17.00 with a total of 1392 h of observations.

# Elberling & Olesen (1999)  
General information  
This study took place in the subarctic alpine zone of Latnjajaure, in northern Sweden. Field work was conducted from May 21 to August 23, 1994. The objective was to describe the plant-flower visitor interaction matrix of this area and compare it with the characteristics of other subarctic alpine systems and with pollination systems of lower latitudes, especially in relation to the role of flies as flower visitors at high latitudes.  
Data type  
The authors recorded their data by counting the number of visits of each flower visitor species to each plant species. Regardless of whether insects were observed to forage for nectar and pollen or to perform sun-basking, they were all classified as flower visitors and potential pollinators and the plant species visited were recorded. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction

# Kaiser-Bunbury et al. (2009)  
General information  
This paper describes the community structure of pollination webs of Mauritian heathland habitats. Visitation rates and interactions strenght are compared between areas heavily invaded by introduced plant species (control site) and areas from which non-native plants were removed (restored site).  
Data type  
The authors have done static observations (sit-and-observe). In this approach the numbers of flowers (within a given area) and observation time vary. To account for these differences, a visitation rate was calculated based on the visits per flower per hour and these values were then averaged by the total observation time.

# Kaiser-Bunbury et al. (2017)  
General information  
Data of plant-pollinator interaction networks collected from the island of Mahé, Seychelles, Indian Ocean. The data sheets contain information on a total of 64 monthly networks collected from 8 isolated mountaintop (a.k.a inselbergs) between September 2012 and April 2013. Of the eight study sites, four were restored by removing all exotic plants, and four sites remained unchanged. All flowering plant species were observed each for a total of approx. 3h per network, adding up to a total of 1525h of observations, during which we recorded 581 unique species–species interactions (links) and 12,235 pollinator visits to flowers. We only included data on flower visitors that touched the reproductive parts of the flowers (here referred to as pollinators: bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, moths, beetles, birds and lizards) and excluded spiders, barkflies, thrips, springtails, true bugs (hemiptera) and ants.   
Data type  
Data are available as Excel files in two different formats. Both data sheets contain an interaction matrix with all observed plant species in rows (also those that did not receive any visitors during this time period) and all pollinator species in columns. The following columns are added:  

·          Treatment – restored and unrestored  

·          Site – Bernica, Casse Dent, Copolia, La Reserve, Rosebelle, Salazie, Tea Plantation, Trois Frères  

·          Month – 1 to 8 (September 2012 to April 2013); constitues the entire main flowering season  

·          Network ID – Indiviual network code consiting of a composite of site and month  

·          Plant species ID  - Code for each plant species  

·          Floral abundance – the number of flowers per sampling cube for each species in a given network  

Values in the cells describing the strength of the interactions between plants and pollinators differs between the two sheets.  
1) In the sheet entitled 64 networks_no.visits each cell contains information on the number of visits (= no.visits). These values do not account for different observation times, the number of observed flowers or the total floral abundance of flowering species across the community.  
2) In the sheet entitled 64 networks_visitfreq each cell contains information on visitation frequency (=visitfreq). Visitation frequency is a fully quantified and standardised visitation rate, caculated as the number of visits/flower/hour*floral abundance (see source publication for more detailed information). This calculation is necessary as an adaptation to focal observations (in contrast to observations during transect walks). Thus, visitation frequency is the equivalent to the measure of visitation in transect methods as transects are sampled proportional to the numbers of flowers in the community. Pollination webs in Fig. 1 in the source publication were drawn based on visitation rate (number of visits/hour/flower), which can be calculated by dividing visitation frequency by the floral abundance  (column F in data sheet) of a given plant species in a network.  
Sheets on plant and pollinator species provide taxonomic and origin information on all plant and pollinator species included in the study.

# Santos et al. (2010)  
General information  
This paper provides a comparative analysis of bees-plants and social wasps-plants interactions in "caatinga", a typical semi-arid vegetation of Northeastern Brazil, based on the author's previously published records from Itatim, Bahia State. Both interaction networks have similar topologies and are nested, asymmetrical and modular. Based on the higher connectance of the social wasps-plants network and in the higher clustering of niches among bees, the authors suggested that the later are more dependent on flowers, and consequently may be under higher interspecific competition.      
Data type and methodological remarks  
Binary matrices describing bees-plants and social wasps-plants interactions with 13 species of social wasps visiting 42 plant species, and 12 bees species visiting 38 plant species. Samples were collected from November 1996 to November 1997, on a monthly basis, along a 3 km long and 20 m wide transect. Two collectors carefully and simultaneously inspected each flowering plant for 5 minutes and flower-visiting bees and wasps were captured using entomological nets.

The study took place in the Mer Bleue peat bog of Ottawa, Canada in 1973. The paper is a preliminary evaluation of the pollination relationships of the major entomophilous plant species of the Mer Bleue.  
Data type  
The authors recorded their data by counting the number of individual flower visitors caught on each plant species. The total number of individuals collected on each plant species provide a rough estimate of the level of visitation that each species received. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.

# Varassin & Sazima (2012)  
General information  
Data describing interactions between bromeliads and their pollinators in the Southern Brazil Atlantic Rainforest. Hummingbirds pollinated 19 out of 23 bromeliad species, of which 11 were also pollinated by bees and/or butterflies.  
Data type  
The authors recorded the identities of Bromeliaceae species, their pollinators and their interaction frequency. Data are presented as a weighted interaction matrix, in which cells with a "0" indicates no interaction and values higher than 0, the frequency of interactions between pair species.

# Vazquez & Simberloff (2002)  
General information  
This paper analyzes the relationship between the degree of specialization of plant and pollinator species and their response to disturbance caused by introduced cattle. The study was conducted in four grazed and four ungrazed sites in and around Nahuel Huapi National Park and surrounding areas in Rio Negro, Argentina from September 1999 to Feburary 2000. For each site, the plant-pollinator interaction network was described.  
Data type  
The authors recorded their data by counting the number of visits of each flower visitor species to each plant species. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.

# Vizentin-Bugoni et al. (2016)  
General information  
Data on interactions between flowering plants native to the Neotropics and associated hummingbirds at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The matrix summarizes observations along 12,000 m of trails at Santa Virgínia Field Station (Serra do Mar State Park, SE Brazil). The authors sampled transects from September 2011 to August 2013, during 4 to 10 days each month, totalizing 2716 h of focal observation. The dataset refers to hummingbird species that touched anthers and stigmas.  
Rarefaction analyses support that the majority of the links were sampled at the study site.  
Data type  
Data are presented as a quantitative interaction matrix (text file without species names). A complementary Excel file provides 7 additional worksheets with data describing species taxonomy, abundances, phenologies, and morphological traits, as listed below:  
- quantitative interaction matrix including species acronyms;  
- plant species names, corresponding acronyms, number of flowers, and relative abundances;  
- hummingbird species names, corresponding acronyms, contacts in transects, frequency of occurrence, and relative frequencies;  
- phenology data for plant species, including monthly records from September 2011 to August 2013  
- phenology data for hummingbird species, including monthly records from September 2011 to August 2013  
- morphological data for plant species, including minimum corolla depth, mean corolla depth and respectives standard deviations and number of observations (n).  
- morphological data for hummingbird species, including mean bill lengths (exposed culmen), respective standard deviations and number of observations (n), tongue extension, and bill + tongue estimations.
