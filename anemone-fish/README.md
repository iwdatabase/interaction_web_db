Sumarized information regarding the datasets in the anemone-fish interaction web data.

# Fautin & Allen (1997) and Ollerton et al. (2007) #
# General information
Data on host anemone use by amphiprionine anemonefish were taken from Fautin & Allen (1997), supplemented by information obtained during the past decade by D.G.F., 
including correction of an error in Fautin & Allen (1997): Macrodactyla doreensis is a host of Amphiprion chrysopterus, not Amphiprion chrysogaster. 
All data are for natural occurrences; in captivity, many anemonefish can live with host anemones that we have never seen them inhabit in nature (indeed, in captivity 
some anemonefish will take up residence in European or temperate Pacific anemones; Fautin & Allen 1997).
# Data type
The authors recorded the identities of anemonefish and their anemone hosts and their interactions. Data are presented as a binary interaction matrix, in which
cells with a "1" indicate an interaction between a pair of species, and a "0" indicates no interaction. The spreadsheet also includes distributional data.

# General information
This paper describes the structure of local anemonefish-anemone networks across the Manado region of Sulawesi, Indonesia, a marine high diversity hot-spot where 7 species of anemonefish (Pomacentridae, Amphiprioniae) were described living symbiotically with 9 sea anemone species (Stichodactylidade and Actiniidae). Each fish species had a preferred anemone host. 
No correlation was found between species richness of anemones and anemonefish across several sites, but all anemones contained at least one fish individual, and there was a strong positive correlation between the number of individual anemonefish and anemones. 
The NODF algorithm indicated that at both local and regional scales the interactions are not significantly nested. The authors concluded that a combination of local conditions with competition forces species that regionally are more generalist to become more specialist.     
# Data type and methodological remarks
Binary matrices describing anemonefish and anemone species interactions in 16 sampling sites of the Manado region. The data is based in field records from 233 anemones and 772 anemonefish individuals observed during 45-60 min SCUBA dives at depth between 1 and 40 m. Sampling sites were chosen trying to include the widest ranges of habitats (vertical slopes, patch reefs, and sandy bottom).
