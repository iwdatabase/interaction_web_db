Sumarized information regarding the datasets in the predator-prey interaction web data.
# Lafferty et al. (2006)  
General information  
The study was conducted in Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve, Carpinteria, Santa Barbara County, California. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of parasites on food-web topology. The results are reported in detail in Lafferty et al (in press) with other publications forthcoming which examine connectance, chain length, vulnerability, etc. This publication also details how taxa and links were selected for inclusion and provides additional information on the species lists.  
Data type  
The matrix breaks down into 4 subwebs: predator-prey, parasite-host, predator-parasite and parasite-parasite. Links are binary (presence or absence of interspecific interactions), but coded by type of trophic interaction and certainty. The links are from a combination of published reports, direct observations, and logical, but presumed interactions. A key is included as a text box in the matrix. The web is being updated regularly as new information is obtained.

General information  
Thhis series of studies took place in streams in New Zealand, Maine and North Carolina (USA). The food webs reported are from comparisons of the effects of land use on stream food web structure regionally (Townsend et al. 1998, Thompson and Townsend in press) and at a continental scale (Thompson and Townsend 2003). Detailed methods are presented in Jaarsma et al. (1998). These food webs have also been the subject of reanalysis for the effects of allocation of effort (Thompson et al. 2001), taxonomic resolution (Thompson and Townsend 2000), and seasonal variability (Thompson and Townsend 1999).  
Data type  
The authors recorded the identities of aquatic insect, algae and fish species and their trophic interactions. Data are presented as a binary interaction matrix, in which cells with a "1" indicate a trophic interaction between a pair of species, and a "0" indicates no interaction.
