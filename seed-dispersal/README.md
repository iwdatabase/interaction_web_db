Sumarized information regarding the datasets in the plant-seed disoerser interaction web data.  
# Beehler (1983)
# General information
This study focused on a forest on the southwest slopes of Mount Missim, north-northeast of Wau, Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea and was completed from July 1978 
to November 1980. While studying the behavior and ecology of four species of birds of paradise in the mountains, the author gathered data on the feeding behavior 
of the local bird species which shared fruit resources..
# Data type
The authors recorded their data by counting the number of visits of each bird species to each plant species. Data are presented as an interaction frequency 
matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.

# Poulin et al. (1999)
# General information
The information on plant phenology and frugivore diet used in this study was taken from two independent studies carried out at Barro Colorado Island (9°9'N, 79°51'W) 
and Soberania National Park (9° 10'N, 79° 7'W) in Central Panama. Both sites have a tropical monsoon climate and support a semideciduous tropical forest with a mature
canopy height of 35 m. The abundance and diet of dispersal agents were studied to investigate both the timing of fruit maturation and the patterns of seed dispersal.
# Data type
The data indicates the number of fruits taken by the bird species mist-netted at the national park.

# Schleuning et al. (2010)
# General information
This paper analyzed specialization and interaction strength in a plant-frugivore network from a Kenyan rain forest in relation to forest stratum (canopy, midstory,
and understory) and forest type (primary and secondary forest). The authors found no effect of forest type, but a strong vertical stratification of the frugivore 
community into obligate and opportunistic feeding guilds. The canopy stratum comprised stronger links and generalized associations, whereas the lower strata were 
composed of weaker links and more specialized interactions.
# Data type and methodological remarks
All plant species with fleshy fruits in an area of ca. 250 ha in northern Kakamega Forest were studied from December 2007 to March 2008, comprising species from 
different forest strata and forest types. For each plant species, representative individuals bearing numerous ripe fruits were selected. According to availability, 
four, three, or two individuals of each species were selected. Five ornithologists observed each plant individual once, from 7:00 to 14:00 in order to record its 
associated frugivore species. For the few plant species with less than four individuals, observations were repeated on the same individual to standardize the sampling 
effort to 28 hours per plant species. Only fruit-eating individuals were recorded and counted, and both mammals and birds were determined to species level. 
Interaction frequency in the quantitative interaction matrix was defined as the number of fruit-eating individuals on a plant species independent of fruit handling 
(including swallowing, pecking, and dropping fruits).

The main data sheet includes the overall matrix giving all relevant information including scientific species names, forest stratum and forest type for each plant 
species, and feeding and habitat guild for each frugivore species. Additional datasheets provide raw interaction matrix for each subweb (i.e., canopy, midstory, 
and understory; primary and secondary forest).

# Snow & Snow (1971)
# General information
This study was conducted in Trinidad from August 1960 through September 1961. The aim of the investigation was to determine to what extent and in what ways the
feeding ecology differs among the various Trinidad bird species.
# Data type
The authors recorded their data by counting the number of visits of each bird species to each plant species. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, 
in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.

This paper examined the feeding preferences of frugivorous birds in relation to the seasonality, abundance, growth forms, and nutritive/energetic value of fruit 
occuring in Wytham woods, near Oxford, South Britain.
