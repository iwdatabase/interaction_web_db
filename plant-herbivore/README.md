Sumarized information regarding the datasets in the plant-herbivore interaction web data.  
# Joern (1979)
# General information
In this paper, the authors examined the feeding patterns of grasshoppers from two arid grassland communities in Trans-Pecos, Texas. The studies took place from May 
until November in 1974 and 1975.
# Data type
The authors recorded the identities of insect and plant species and their interactions. Data are presented as a binary interaction matrix, in which cells with 
a "1" indicate an interaction between a pair of species, and a "0" indicates no interaction.

# Leather (1991)
# General information
In this paper, the mactolepidoptera feeding on Prunus species in Britain and Finland are examined, together with the influence of host range and plant history on 
the breadth of insect diet and insect species richness.
