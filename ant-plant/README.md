# General information
This describes de ant-plant interaction network in the rainforest at the Australian Canopy Crane in Cape Tribulation, Far North Queensland, Australia (16°07' S, 145°27' E, 80 m a.s.l.) and adjacent forests within 5 km radius of the crane site, including patches of open secondary forest. Counts of ant colonies attending extrafloral (EFN) and floral nectaries (FN) are provided, as well as independent abundance estimates for ant colonies based on sugar bait experiment (from Blüthgen and Fiedler 2004). Ants with zero abundance are those not recorded during bait experiments. For plants, number of plant individuals on which any insect were recorded on nectaries given as abundance estimate. Plant life forms: cl = climber, he = herb, sh = shrub, tr = tree, pa = palm. 
# Data type
Frequency of interaction was estimated as the number of ant individuals of a particular species collected on a plant species. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.

# Davidson et al. (1989) #
# General information
This study took place in 1985 and 1986, during September, October, and November. The authors surveyed variation in the ant associates of eight myrmecophytes of the tropical moist forests of western Amazonia.
# Data type
The authors recorded their data by counting the number of visits of each ant species to each plant species. Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.

# Davidson & Fisher (1991) #
# General information
In this paper the authors discuss why it is wrong to assume that reciprical extreme specialization is a prerequiste for coevolution and consider how different kinds of asymmetry in specialization lead to different forms of coevolution.

Data are presented as an interaction frequency matrix, in which cells with positive integers indicate the frequency of interaction between a pair of species, and cells with zeros indicate no interaction.

# Fonseca & Ganade (1996) #
# General information
This study was done in the Central Amazonian rainforest, north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil from June through August in 1990. The main objectives were to quantitatively describe the ant-myrmecophyte matrix, to search for patterns of compartmentalization, and to compare the results from the ant-plant system with those from other mutualistic systems.
